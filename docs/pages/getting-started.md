# Getting Started with Roact
The simplest way to get started is to download an installer script from the [Roact GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/releases).

Install it somewhere that's accessible by your code, and then load it using `requrie`:

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local Roact = require(ReplicatedStorage.Roact)

-- Now you have Roact!
```
